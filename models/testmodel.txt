# Any line starting with a '#' is considered to be a comment and ignored
# any line starting with a 'm' is a material definition a unique index for
# the material is given next, followed by its density followed by colour,
# then its name
# note that for the colour each pair of digits is a hexadecimal number
# in the range 0-FF (0-255 decimal) representing a colour component:
# B8 - red component
# 73 - green component
# 73 - blue component
# e.g. material 0 has a density of 8960 and is called copper,
# its colour is a redish-grey (R=b8, G = 73, B = 73)
m 0 8960 b87373 copper
# material 1 has a density of 2700 and is called aluminium,
# its colour is grey (R=bc, G = bc, B = bc)
m 1 2700 bcbcbc aluminium
# Any line starting with a 'v' is a vertex (a vector)
# the 1st, 2nd and 3rd are the x, y and z coordinates
# e.g. vertex 0 is positioned at 0., 0., 0. (the . is just to emphasize floating point numbers)
v 0 0. 0. 0.
v 1 1. 0. 0.
v 2 1. 1. 0.
v 3 0. 1. 0.
v 4 0. 0. 1.
v 5 1. 0. 1.
v 6 1. 1. 1.
v 7 0. 1. 1.
# 8 vertices have now been defined, these can be used as the corners
# of a hexahedral cell
# a cell is defined by a line beginning with a 'c'. The second parameter
# the cell index, the third is a character (either h - hexahedral, p -
# pyramid, t - tetrahedral). Thie 4th in the index of a material that the
# cell is made of and the remaining numbers state which node defines
# each corner.
# e.g. cell 0 is a hexahredal, made from material 0 (copper) which and
# has nodes 0 - 7 define its vertices
c 0 h 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

## Second example
# define some more vertices for a second tetrahedral (4 more)
v 8 2. 0. 0.
v 9 2. 0 0.
v 10 3. 1 0.
v 11 2.5 0.5 1.
# cell 1 is a tetrahedral made from material 1
# (aluminium) defined by vertices 8,9,10,11
c 1 t 1 8 9 10 11
